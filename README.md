# The Relationship Between Country GDP and CO2 Emissions Is Changing Over Time
Historically, increases in countries’ gross domestic products (GDPs) have been strongly positively correlated with increases in their carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which is concerning because CO2 emissions are a primary cause of global warming (Ritchie, 2021). We investigated if this relationship between countries’ GDPs and CO2 emissions has changed over time. Our results will improve understanding of the relationship between a country’s economic growth and its CO2 emissions. This project started as a class final project for Applied Data Analysis and Statistical Inference (STAT 260) at Wellesley College in fall 2022 using R (tidyverse, ggplot, dplyr).
